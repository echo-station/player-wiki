# Echo Station

![static/logo.png](./static/logo.png)

Welcome to Echo Station! We hope you enjoy your stay.

This wiki contains helpful information for everything you need or may want to know. This includes [Rules](./rules/index.md), in-game documents such as [Space Law](./documents/space-law.md), [Standard Operating Procedures](./documents/standard-operating-procedure.md), and [Alert Procedure](./documents/alert-procedure.md).

## What is Echo Station?

Echo Station is a fork off Delta-V, and is a medium roleplay (MRP) server though with a stronger-than-average focus on roleplay.

Many of us felt that the player community of larger MRP servers often decline to LRP when combined with large population caps. This is what made us choose to make quality roleplay one of our core values.

## Distinguishing features

We're pretty new, so there's not many to show off yet, but do take a peek at our [Features](./features.md) page!

## Important reading

Prior to playing on Echo Station, we recommend reading the following documents:

- [Rules](./rules/index.md)
- [Space Law](./documents/space-law.md)
- [Standard Operating Procedures](./documents/standard-operating-procedure.md)
- [Alert Procedure](./documents/alert-procedure.md)

## Policies

### Roleplay first

We value fun roleplay and character development over winning. If you're more focussed on winning or mechanics than on interacting with others, this server is probably not a good fit for you.

### Server and Role whitelists

Security, Command and most antag roles require [Server Whitelisting](./whitelists/server-whitelist.md). Visit our general [Whitelisting page](./whitelists/index.md) to learn more.

Captain, Head of Security and Warden require explicit [Role Whitelisting](./whitelists/role-whitelist.md).
