# Echo Station

Welcome to Echo Station! We hope you enjoy your stay.

This wiki contains helpful information for everything you need or may want to know. This includes [Rules](./rules/index.md), in-game documents such as [Space Law](./documents/space-law.md), [Standard Operating Procedures](./documents/standard-operating-procedure.md), and [Alert Procedure](./documents/alert-procedure.md).

## What is Echo Station?

Echo Station is a fork of Delta-V. After several mechanical changes many of us were displeased with that were merged,
including the removal of the Atmospheric Technician's fire-fighting door remote and pipe-stacking, many of us felt the
desire to take control into our own hands. Both of these were considered necessary for basic functionality of that role.

In addition, many of us felt that the player community of Delta-V was declining to become LRP. This is what made us
choose to make quality roleplay one of our core values.

## Important reading

Prior to playing on Echo Station, we recommend reading the following documents:

- [Rules](./rules/index.md)
- [Space Law](./documents/space-law.md)
- [Standard Operating Procedures](./documents/standard-operating-procedure.md)
- [Alert Procedure](./documents/alert-procedure.md)

## Policies

### Roleplay first

We value fun roleplay and character development over winning. If you're more focussed on winning or mechanics than on interacting with others, this server is probably not a good fit for you.

### Server and Role whitelists

Security, Command and most antag roles require [Server Whitelisting](./whitelists/server-whitelist.md). Visit our general [Whitelisting page](./whitelists/index.md) to learn more.

Captain, Head of Security and Warden require explicit [Role Whitelistin](./whitelists/role-whitelist.md).
