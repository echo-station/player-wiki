# Role Whitelists

Just like the [Server Whitelist](./server-whitelist.md), the **Role Whitelist** is in place to make sure that some high-risk roles are played by players/characters that can handle those roles.

This only affects roles that are typically *targeted* by many antagonists, and are often also critical to *dealing* with antagonists.

## Benefits

You get access to the roles you apply for, from the following list:

- Captain
- Head of Security
- Warden

## Applying

To apply to be **Role** whitelisted, simply fill out this template:

```
**SS14 Username:** example123
**Name(s) of your character(s):** John Doe, Jane Doe
**Role(s) you are requesting:**
**Tell us about the character(s) you are requesting for:**
**Why is this character fit for this role?:**
```

Submit the template in [#whitelist-requests](https://discord.com/channels/1263024087647649853/1265048080856780892) on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/u3qKDyrDFQ).

## What we look for

- You are already [server whitelisted](./server-whitelist.md).
- Your character(s) are suited for the role(s).
- You have a good enough reputation (no recent bans, few recent notes/warnings).
- Roleplay (by reviewing a round you've played on Echo).
