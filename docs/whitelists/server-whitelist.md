# Server Whitelist

As Echo Station fundamentally revolves around roleplay, using a server whitelist is a great way to make sure new players are a fit for our community.

We try to keep the whitelist process as simple as possible.

## Benefits

Being server whitelisted grants you the following accesses:

- All Security roles
- All Command roles
- All Senior roles (Senior Engineer, Senior Physician, ..)
- Salvage Specialist
- All antagonists

## Applying

To apply to be server whitelisted, simply fill out this template:

```
**SS14 Username:** example123
**Servers you've played on:**
**Playtime per server (screenshots preferred):**
**Name(s) of your character(s):** John Doe, Jane Doe
**Tell us about your character(s)**:
```

Submit the template in [#whitelist-requests](https://discord.com/channels/1263024087647649853/1265048080856780892) on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/u3qKDyrDFQ).

## What we look for

The things we look for are:

- Basic understanding of how the game works
- Characters with their own personalities and backgrounds
- Roleplay (by reviewing a round you've played on Echo)
