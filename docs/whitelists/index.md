# Whitelists

At this time, Echo uses a combination of **Server** and **Role** whitelisting to ensure all current and future players can enjoy high quality roleplay and have fun interactions.

## Connecting

You **do not** need to be whitelisted to connect and play on Echo Station.

## Server whitelist

If you are not Server Whitelisted, you do not have access to the following roles:

- All Security roles
- All Command roles
- All Senior roles (Senior Engineer, Senior Physician, ..)
- Salvage Specialist
- All antagonists, exluding:
  - Space Dragon
  - Initial Infected

To learn more, visit [Server Whitelist](./server-whitelist.md).

## Role whitelists

**On top** of those, you require explicit role whitelisting for the following roles:

- Warden
- Head of Security
- Captain

To learn more, go to [Role Whitelists](./role-whitelist.md).

## Applying

Our whitelisting procedure is to apply in the [#whitelist-requests](https://discord.com/channels/1263024087647649853/1265048080856780892) channel on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/u3qKDyrDFQ).
