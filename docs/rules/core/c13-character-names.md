# C13. Use realistic character names, and do not use names of famous people

- No names of people or characters from the real world
- No titles/honorifics
- Must follow all other rules (no slurs/sexual names/etc)
- Usernames, objects, random characters, very "low effort" names, "meta" names, or otherwise implausible names cannot be used as names. See examples below.
- Admin rulings on IC names are final and disputes should be done through the forums, not by refusing to comply with an admin

## Clarification on "Meta" Names
Meta names are ones which attempt to take advantage of some game mechanic or game design choice. "Urist McHands" is a meta name because it is the default name used for admin spawned humans. "Operator Whiskey" is a meta name because it follows the naming pattern of nuclear operatives. This rule is not intended to prevent things like nuclear operatives using a fake ID with names that appear to be nuclear operative names if they decide that they want to do that.
