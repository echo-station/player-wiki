# C12. Players must be and act at least 17 years old

All players must be at least 17 years old. Additionally, all players must act at least as mature as a 17 year old. Admins may ban someone who they believe is acting less mature than a 17 year old, even if the player is known to be significantly older than 17 years old.

Anyone who connects to the servers is a player, even if they don't actually play in a round.
